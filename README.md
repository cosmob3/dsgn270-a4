# DSGN-270 / Assignment 4 - Figma Mockup / Bryan Velasco

## TODO:

- Use already created library to create a webpage mock-up
- Needed:
  - X Nav Bar
  - X Hero Section
  - X Short Bio
  - X Cards With Servies
  - X Footer

Building this mock-up was not very hard and was actually a lot of fun. I will say though, it is a bit time consuming but it can really help to see what the website should look like.
